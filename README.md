# Inferno Prayer Flicking Practice Tool

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a simple single page application that allows users to practice prayer flicking boss monsters found in [Old School Runescape](https://oldschool.runescape.com/). It can be used to practice two tick flicking, one tick flicking, or lazy flicking. Every cycle (or tick) is 0.6 seconds long. Monsters turn red on the tick they attack, and do 10 damage for each hit not prayed against. The app includes a mutable metronome to help users get into a rhythm with their prayer flicking, and also includes a toggle setting to show when the 'blob' is detecting their prayer. There is also a tick counter that records the users personal best times.

## Netlify Link

This project has been deployed and is currently hosted on Netlify. Click [this link](https://two-tick-flick.netlify.app/) to run the app in your browser.

Alternatively, it can be run on your local machine with npm. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
